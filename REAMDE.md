# rancher-cli-cljs

Small and simple rancher cli implemented on clojurescript

## Overview

This is just a basic cli tool that talks to the rancher API.
It is part of a series of exercises I'm doing, implementing the same program in different functional programming languages to see
which one better fits my needs and the kind of projects I usually build.
This implementation runs on node-js after the code has been compiled to JS.
